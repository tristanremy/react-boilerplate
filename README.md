# React Boilerplate
First React.js boilerplate to learn more about the tools I get to use everyday, especialy webpack config and babel loaders.

## Instructions

```console
# Install project dependencies (from package.json)
yarn

# Start the development server
yarn start
```

## ToDo

- [x] Init
- [x] Webpack config
- [ ] Add ESLint
- [ ] Add Test management
